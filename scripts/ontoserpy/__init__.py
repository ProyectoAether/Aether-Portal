"""OntoSerPy

This is a script used for serializing OWL ontology into multiple non standard 
format JSON files. It will calculate multiple ontologies' statistics,
compute their metadata and collection of triples.

THIS SCRIPT IS INTENDED to be used in conjunction with Aether Portal frontend
page, but it may be useful for other projects as well as it provides a naive
interface for consuming ontologies' data.
